## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

First of all, I would introduce myself as Eric's bank company. Then, I would create a fake transaction and convince him that we have found a huge transaction recently that was made from his bank account and ask if he was conscious of that. If not, I would try to ask him for his account pin number because I need the pin in order to access his bank account. Now I have his pin number, I would once again convince him that in order to make his bank account more secure, we could set up some security questions. Then, I would have the opportunity to set up these security questions to his mother's maiden name, city he was born in, and the name of his first pet. Finally, I would ask him to try to log in to his account using a browser, and by this time, I can ask what browser he is currently using. Once he successfully logged in to his online account, I could let him know that his bank account is now secure, and cancel the fake transaction that I created in the beginning.


### Part 2 (60 points)

1. Exposed ports: He should close those open ports and prevent people from actually getting into his website instead of having open ports.

2. Weak passwords: His password is one of the most common passwords. He should create a longer password with different variation of symbols and alphabets to prevent other people from guessing them easily.

3. Username: He should have different username for different platforms so people can't easily find him on all social media

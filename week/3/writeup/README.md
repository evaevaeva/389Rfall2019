## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

First of all, I would introduce myself as Eric's bank company. Then, I would create a fake transaction and convince him that we have found a huge transaction recently that was made from his bank account and ask if he was conscious of that. If not, I would try to ask him for his account pin number because I need the pin in order to access his bank account. Now I have his pin number, I would once again convince him that in order to make his bank account more secure, we could set up some security questions. Then, I would have the opportunity to set up these security questions to his mother's maiden name, city she was she born in, and the name of her first pet. Finally, I would ask him to try to log in to his account using a browser, and by this time, I can ask what browser is he currently using. Once he successfully logged in to his online account, I could let him know that he bank account is now secure, and cancel the fake transaction that I created in the beginning.


### Part 2 (60 points)

Eric Norman has recently discovered that Watsam's web server has been broken into by the crafty CMSC389R ethical hackers. After reading your published report, he has reached out to you to seek guidance in how he can repair some of the vulnerabilities that you have discovered.
Choose 3 specific vulnerabilities from homework 2 that you have identified (ie. exposed ports, weak passwords, etc.) and write a brief summary of some suggestions you can provide Eric for the Wattsamp web server and admin server. Be as thorough as possible in your answer, use specific examples and citing online research into security techniques that could be applied to the servers (ie. firewall, IDS/IPS, password managers, etc.).

1. Exposed ports: He should close those open ports and prevent people from actually getting into his website instead of having open ports.

2. Weak passwords: His password is one of the most common passwords. He should create a longer password with different variation of symbols and alphabets to prevent other people from guessing them easily.

3. Username: He should have different username for different platforms so people can't easily find him on all social media.

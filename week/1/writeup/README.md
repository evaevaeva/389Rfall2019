I think it is necessary to report to the boss about the firmware security issue and postpone the ECU's release immediately.

First of all, if the company releases the ECU with security issues to the public, it is going to endanger people's life. It is not morally ethical to put the public in danger without telling them the consequences. Moreover, releasing security issue products to the public early will not solve the problem because the public will find out about the security issue of the ECU once they bought it.

On the other hand, if we postpone the release of current firmware with security issues to the public, the company may lose money in the short term.

For the company to survive in a long run, we would need to look ahead in the future. Releasing the dangerous firmware to the public may be beneficial for the company for short term because our company may make more profit by promoting the new ECU to the public. However, after the security issue of the ECU is exposed to the public, the company would lose its reputation of having dangerous firmware and endangering the public. Therefore, the best solution to this current issue is to discuss with the manager or boss to figure out a solution to the firmware and release the product once it pass through all security checks.
